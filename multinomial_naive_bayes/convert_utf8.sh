#!/bin/bash

# Created by LEXO, http://www.lexo.ch
# Version 1.0
#
# This bash script converts all files from within a given directory from any charset to UTF-8 recursively
# It takes track of those files that cannot be converted automatically. Usually this happens when the original charset
# cannot be recognized. In that case you should load the corresponding file into a development editor like Netbeans
# or Komodo and apply the UTF-8 charset manually.
#
# This is free software. Use and distribute but do it at your own risk. 
# We will not take any responsibilities for failures and do not provide any support.

# This array contains file extensions that need to be checked no matter if the filetype is binary or not.
# Reason: Sometimes it happens that .htm(l), .php, .tpl files etc. have a binary charset type. This script
# does not convert binary file types into utf-8 because it might destroy your data. So we need to include these file types
# into the conversion system manually to tell the conversion that binary files with these special extensions may be converted anyway.
